# Camera App with Object Detection using TensorFlow.js, CocoSsd, and Expo

This project is a fully functional camera application built with React Native (Expo) that leverages the power of TensorFlow.js for real-time object detection. It utilizes the pre-trained CocoSsd model to identify various objects within the camera view, providing an interactive and informative experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection:** The app seamlessly integrates TensorFlow.js, enabling it to detect objects in real-time using the camera feed.
- **CocoSsd Model:** This pre-trained model, renowned for its efficiency and accuracy, empowers the app to recognize a vast array of objects from the common objects in context (COCO) dataset.
- **Expo for Cross-Platform Development:** Expo streamlines the development process, allowing you to create this feature-rich app for both iOS and Android platforms with minimal code modifications.
